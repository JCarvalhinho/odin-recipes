    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Risotto is an Italian dish made by cooking a starchy, short grain rice like arborio with stock until it becomes creamy. <br>
        When you serve it on a plate, risotto should spread out into a silky, spoonable pool.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken stock, or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 lb shiitake mushroom(455 g), stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves
            kosher salt, to taste
            freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups arborio rice(200 g)</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine(120 mL), or lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese(110 g), plus more for serving</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh parsley(10 g), for serving</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the stock to a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Once the stock is boiling, reduce the heat to low or remove the pan from the heat and keep nearby.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a wide, tall pot over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the shiitake mushrooms and butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have cooked down and browned.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, stir, and cook for 1 minute, until the garlic is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and stir until fully coated in the mushroom mixture. Let the rice toast for 1-2 minutes, until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Add the white wine and cook until evaporated, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot stock and stir to combine. Cook, stirring frequently, until the stock is fully absorbed by the rice.</li>
        <li>Continue to add the stock, ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring continuously, until fully absorbed, 15-20 minutes. Depending on how fast the rice cooks, there may be leftover stock.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is al dente, remove from the heat. Add the Parmesan and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Garnish the risotto with parsley, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
